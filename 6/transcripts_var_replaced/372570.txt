if VARIABLE is equal to 1 or VARIABLE is less than or equal to 20 and VARIABLE increments by 1 each time if VARIABLE FUNCTION 3 does not equal 0 and VARIABLE FUNCTION 5 does not equal 0 then FUNCTION VARIABLE else if VARIABLE FUNCTION 3 is equal 0 FUNCTION fizz if VARIABLE FUNCTION 5 is equal to 0 FUNCTION buzz then put the new line and end the for loop
