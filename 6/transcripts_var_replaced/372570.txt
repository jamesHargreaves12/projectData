if VARIABLE_0 is equal to NUMBER or VARIABLE_0 is less than or equal to NUMBER and VARIABLE_0 increments by NUMBER each time if VARIABLE_0 FUNCTION_CALL_2 NUMBER does not equal NUMBER and VARIABLE_0 FUNCTION_CALL_2 NUMBER does not equal NUMBER then FUNCTION_CALL_3 VARIABLE_0 else if VARIABLE_0 FUNCTION_CALL_2 NUMBER is equal NUMBER FUNCTION_CALL_3 STR if VARIABLE_0 FUNCTION_CALL_2 NUMBER is equal to NUMBER FUNCTION_CALL_3 STR then put the STR and end the for loop
