VARIABLE_1 equals the FUNCTION_CALL_4 of the VARIABLE_0 for VARIABLE_2 in FUNCTION_CALL_5 NUMBER to VARIABLE_1 over NUMBER inclusive if character at index VARIABLE_2 in VARIABLE_0 does not equal character at index VARIABLE_1 minus NUMBER minus VARIABLE_2 of VARIABLE_0 then return false end the for loop then return true
