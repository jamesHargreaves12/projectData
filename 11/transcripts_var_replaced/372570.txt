let's VARIABLE_1 equal the FUNCTION_CALL_4 of the VARIABLE_0 divided by NUMBER and then do a for loop for VARIABLE_2 is equal to NUMBER where VARIABLE_2 is less than or equal to VARIABLE_1 increment VARIABLE_2 by NUMBER each time and then do if the VARIABLE_0 at VARIABLE_2 is not equal to the VARIABLE_0 at the FUNCTION_CALL_4 of the VARIABLE_0 minus VARIABLE_2 then return false end the if and end the for loop there then return true
