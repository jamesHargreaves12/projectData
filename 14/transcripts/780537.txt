 define a variable named len and set that to be equal to the length of the list next recursively sort the first half of the list and store this in sorted first and then recursively sort of second off the list and store this in a variable named sorted second defined variables j and k and set both equal to 0 define a list of length len and call that result for i between 0 and len if the j    th element is sorted first is less than the k    th of sorted second then set the i    th element of results to be the j    th element of sorted first and increment j otherwise set the i    th element of results to be the k    th element of sorted second and increment j end the loop and return result
