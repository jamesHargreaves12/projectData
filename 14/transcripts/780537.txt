 define a variable named len and set that to be equal to the length of the list next recursively sort the first half of the list and store this in sorted first and then recursively sort of second off the list and store this in a variable named sorted second defined variables j and k and set both equal to 0 define a list of length len and call that result for i between 0 and len if the jth element is sorted first is less than the kth of sorted second then set the ith element of results to be the jth element of sorted first and increment j otherwise set the ith element of results to be the kth element of sorted second and increment j end the loop and return result
