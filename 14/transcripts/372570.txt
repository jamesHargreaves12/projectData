 check if the length of the input list is less than or equal to one. If it is returned the input list. Let the pivot equal the first item the input list. And then create a less less than list which is empty and a more than list source empty for each item in the input list. If the item is greater than the pivot. put It in the more than list. Else put it in the less than list end the for loop there and then recursively sort the less than list and recursively sort the more that list and then compose the less than less then the pivot then the more the list and return that
