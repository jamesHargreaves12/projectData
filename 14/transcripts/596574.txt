 len is the length of the input list if len is 0 or 1 return the input list else sorted left equals mergesort of input list from index 0 to index len over 2 sorted right equals mergesort of input list from index len over 2 plus 1 to len left pointer equals 0 right pointer equals 0 merged equals the empty list while left pointer is less than the length of the sorted left or right pointer is less than the length of sorted right if the right pointer is greater than equal to the length of sorted right or the left pointer it is less than the length of sorted left and sorted left at index left pointer is less than equal to sorted right at index right pointer then append sorted left index left pointer onto merged left pointer equals left pointer plus 1 else append sorted right at index right pointer onto merged right pointer equals right pointer plus 1 end while loop return merged
