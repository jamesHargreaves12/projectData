 define a variable named VARIABLE and set that to be equal to the FUNCTION of the VARIABLE next recursively sort the FUNCTION of the VARIABLE and store this in VARIABLE and then recursively sort of second off the VARIABLE and store this in a variable named VARIABLE defined variables VARIABLE and VARIABLE and set both equal to NUMBER define a VARIABLE of FUNCTION VARIABLE and call that VARIABLE for VARIABLE between NUMBER and VARIABLE if the VARIABLE  th element is VARIABLE is less than the VARIABLE  th of VARIABLE then set the VARIABLE  th element of results to be the VARIABLE  th element of VARIABLE and increment VARIABLE otherwise set the VARIABLE  th element of results to be the VARIABLE  th element of VARIABLE and increment VARIABLE end the loop and return VARIABLE
