define a variable named VARIABLE_5 and set that to be equal to the FUNCTION_CALL_10 of the VARIABLE_4 next recursively sort the FUNCTION_CALL_12 of the VARIABLE_4 and store this in VARIABLE_2 and then recursively sort of second off the VARIABLE_4 and store this in a variable named VARIABLE_1 defined variables VARIABLE_6 and VARIABLE_7 and set both equal to NUMBER define a VARIABLE_4 of FUNCTION_CALL_10 VARIABLE_5 and call that VARIABLE_3 for VARIABLE_8 between NUMBER and VARIABLE_5 if the VARIABLE_6 th element is VARIABLE_2 is less than the VARIABLE_7 th of VARIABLE_1 then set the VARIABLE_8 th element of results to be the VARIABLE_6 th element of VARIABLE_2 and increment VARIABLE_6 otherwise set the VARIABLE_8 th element of results to be the VARIABLE_7 th element of VARIABLE_1 and increment VARIABLE_6 end the loop and return VARIABLE_3
