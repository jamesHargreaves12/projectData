 define a variable named VARIABLE and set that to be equal to the VARIABLE of the VARIABLE next recursively sort the VARIABLE of the VARIABLE and store this in VARIABLE and then recursively sort of second off the VARIABLE and store this in a variable named VARIABLE defined variables VARIABLE and VARIABLE and set both equal to 0 define a VARIABLE of VARIABLE VARIABLE and call that VARIABLE for VARIABLE between 0 and VARIABLE if the VARIABLE th element is VARIABLE is less than the VARIABLE th of VARIABLE then set the VARIABLE th element of results to be the VARIABLE th element of VARIABLE and increment VARIABLE otherwise set the VARIABLE th element of results to be the VARIABLE th element of VARIABLE and increment VARIABLE end the loop and return VARIABLE
