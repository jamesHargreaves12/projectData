if the FUNCTION_CALL_10 of the VARIABLE_0 is NUMBER or NUMBER return the VARIABLE_0 otherwise let variable VARIABLE_1 equal the FUNCTION_CALL_10 of the VARIABLE_0 integer div NUMBER let VARIABLE_4 equal FUNCTION_CALL_11 of VARIABLE_0 indices beginning to half way and VARIABLE_5 equal FUNCTION_CALL_11 of VARIABLE_0 indices VARIABLE_1 to the end let VARIABLE_7 and VARIABLE_8 equals NUMBER and VARIABLE_6 be an empty list while VARIABLE_7 plus VARIABLE_8 is less than the FUNCTION_CALL_10 of the VARIABLE_0 let VARIABLE_2 equal VARIABLE_4 at index VARIABLE_7 let VARIABLE_3 equal VARIABLE_5 at index VARIABLE_8 if VARIABLE_2 is less than or equal to VARIABLE_3 set VARIABLE_6 at index VARIABLE_7 plus VARIABLE_8 to VARIABLE_2 and increment VARIABLE_7 otherwise set VARIABLE_6 at index VARIABLE_7 plus VARIABLE_8 to VARIABLE_3 and increment VARIABLE_8 end if end while return VARIABLE_6 end if
