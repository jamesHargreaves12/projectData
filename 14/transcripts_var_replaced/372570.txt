 check if the FUNCTION of the VARIABLE is less than or equal to NUMBER if it is return the VARIABLE let the VARIABLE equal the first VARIABLE in the VARIABLE and then create a VARIABLE which is empty and a VARIABLE which is also empty for each VARIABLE in the VARIABLE if the VARIABLE is greater than the VARIABLE put it in the VARIABLE else put it in the VARIABLE end the for loop there and then recursively sort the VARIABLE and recursively sort the more that list and then FUNCTION the less than less then the VARIABLE then the more the list and return that
