check if the FUNCTION_CALL_7 of the VARIABLE_2 is less than or equal to NUMBER if it is return the VARIABLE_2 let the VARIABLE_4 equal the first VARIABLE_5 in the VARIABLE_2 and then create a VARIABLE_0 which is empty and a VARIABLE_1 which is also empty for each VARIABLE_5 in the VARIABLE_2 if the VARIABLE_5 is greater than the VARIABLE_4 put it in the VARIABLE_1 else put it in the VARIABLE_0 end the for loop there and then recursively sort the VARIABLE_0 and recursively sort the more that list and then FUNCTION_CALL_11 the less than less then the VARIABLE_4 then the more the list and return that
