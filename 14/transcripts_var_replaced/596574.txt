VARIABLE_7 is the FUNCTION_CALL_9 of the VARIABLE_4 if VARIABLE_7 is NUMBER or NUMBER return the VARIABLE_4 else VARIABLE_3 equals FUNCTION_CALL_10 of VARIABLE_4 from index NUMBER to index VARIABLE_7 over NUMBER VARIABLE_1 equals FUNCTION_CALL_10 of VARIABLE_4 from index VARIABLE_7 over NUMBER plus NUMBER to VARIABLE_7 VARIABLE_2 equals NUMBER VARIABLE_0 equals NUMBER VARIABLE_5 equals the empty list while VARIABLE_2 is less than the FUNCTION_CALL_9 of the VARIABLE_3 or VARIABLE_0 is less than the FUNCTION_CALL_9 of VARIABLE_1 if the VARIABLE_0 is greater than equal to the FUNCTION_CALL_9 of VARIABLE_1 or the VARIABLE_2 it is less than the FUNCTION_CALL_9 of VARIABLE_3 and VARIABLE_3 at index VARIABLE_2 is less than equal to VARIABLE_1 at index VARIABLE_0 then FUNCTION_CALL_12 VARIABLE_3 index VARIABLE_2 onto VARIABLE_5 VARIABLE_2 equals VARIABLE_2 plus NUMBER else FUNCTION_CALL_12 VARIABLE_1 at index VARIABLE_0 onto VARIABLE_5 VARIABLE_0 equals VARIABLE_0 plus NUMBER end while loop return VARIABLE_5
