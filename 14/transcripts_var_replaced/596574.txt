 VARIABLE is the FUNCTION of the VARIABLE if VARIABLE is 0 or 1 return the VARIABLE else VARIABLE equals FUNCTION of VARIABLE from index 0 to index VARIABLE over 2 VARIABLE equals FUNCTION of VARIABLE from index VARIABLE over 2 plus 1 to FUNCTION VARIABLE equals 0 VARIABLE equals 0 VARIABLE equals the empty list while VARIABLE is less than the FUNCTION of the VARIABLE or VARIABLE is less than the FUNCTION of VARIABLE if the VARIABLE is greater than equal to the FUNCTION of VARIABLE or the VARIABLE it is less than the FUNCTION of VARIABLE and VARIABLE at index VARIABLE is less than equal to VARIABLE at index VARIABLE then FUNCTION VARIABLE index VARIABLE onto VARIABLE VARIABLE equals VARIABLE plus 1 else FUNCTION VARIABLE at index VARIABLE onto VARIABLE VARIABLE equals VARIABLE plus 1 end while loop return VARIABLE
