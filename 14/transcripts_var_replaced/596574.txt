VARIABLE is the FUNCTION_CALL of the VARIABLE if VARIABLE is NUMBER or NUMBER return the VARIABLE else VARIABLE equals FUNCTION_CALL of VARIABLE from index NUMBER to index VARIABLE over NUMBER VARIABLE equals FUNCTION_CALL of VARIABLE from index VARIABLE over NUMBER plus NUMBER to VARIABLE VARIABLE equals NUMBER VARIABLE equals NUMBER VARIABLE equals the empty list while VARIABLE is less than the FUNCTION_CALL of the VARIABLE or VARIABLE is less than the FUNCTION_CALL of VARIABLE if the VARIABLE is greater than equal to the FUNCTION_CALL of VARIABLE or the VARIABLE it is less than the FUNCTION_CALL of VARIABLE and VARIABLE at index VARIABLE is less than equal to VARIABLE at index VARIABLE then FUNCTION_CALL VARIABLE index VARIABLE onto VARIABLE VARIABLE equals VARIABLE plus NUMBER else FUNCTION_CALL VARIABLE at index VARIABLE onto VARIABLE VARIABLE equals VARIABLE plus NUMBER end while loop return VARIABLE
