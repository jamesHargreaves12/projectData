 VARIABLE is the VARIABLE of the VARIABLE if VARIABLE is 0 or 1 return the VARIABLE else VARIABLE equals VARIABLE of VARIABLE from index 0 to index VARIABLE over 2 VARIABLE equals VARIABLE of VARIABLE from index VARIABLE over 2 plus 1 to VARIABLE VARIABLE equals 0 VARIABLE equals 0 VARIABLE equals the empty list while VARIABLE is less than the VARIABLE of the VARIABLE or VARIABLE is less than the VARIABLE of VARIABLE if the VARIABLE is greater than equal to the VARIABLE of VARIABLE or the VARIABLE it is less than the VARIABLE of VARIABLE and VARIABLE at index VARIABLE is less than equal to VARIABLE at index VARIABLE then VARIABLE VARIABLE index VARIABLE onto VARIABLE VARIABLE equals VARIABLE plus 1 else VARIABLE VARIABLE at index VARIABLE onto VARIABLE VARIABLE equals VARIABLE plus 1 end while loop return VARIABLE
